## Who Am I?

I am an MIT Materials Engineer turned developer. My coding skill are mostly self taught and I specialize in platform and infrastructure technologies like chef, puppet, mesos, docker, and so on...

## Work Experience

<img style="height: 4em; float: right" src="{{ site.url }}/images/hubspot.png"/>

#### HubSpot, Cambridge

##### Infrastructure Engineer (Nov 2014 - Now)

At HubSpot I work on the Platform team, making tools that make other developer's lives easier. My work spans accross the stack with the majority being backend work, but also occasionally dipping into the static applications and UIs that wrap our mesos, nginx, and other infrastructure resources. I also contribute heavily to HubSpot's open source mesos scheduler [Singularity](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity) and load balancer management api [Baragon](https://github.com/HubSpot/Baragon).

#### Gazelle, Boston

##### DevOps Engineer (Nov 2013 - Nov 2014)

At Gazelle I built up my Ruby and Rails skills and was introduced to working in DevOps for the first time. I got quite good at chef and ended up revamping the infrastructure by adding automation for configuration and deployment and eventually creating an application to wrap it all and make it easier for developers to use.

##### Systems Integration Analyst (Aug 2012 - Nov 2013)
